            <div class="item item-4">Most small businesses are ran by entrepreneurs who manage their businesses at home.
                Occassionally,
                you may find these businesses having pop-ups at local markets, festivals, and events. However, with
                no physical location firmly established, it is difficult for the average population to know that
                these businesses exist other than word of mouth.
